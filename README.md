# My Resume

I got fed up with screwing around with styles in Microsoft Word and decided to
use CSS for my resume instead. Then I decided to make it with Vue because, 1) I
wanted to use components and have a JSON-based system, basically what amounts to
a theme, and 2) because I can! ðŸ¥³

## Running

This is just a Vue app, so you can run it with

```console
$ npm run serve
```

and build it with

```console
$ npm run build
```

The `CoverLetter.vue` view is not available in production &mdash; only when
running locally.
