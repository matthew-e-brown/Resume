# My Resume

I got fed up with screwing around with styles in Microsoft Word and decided to
use CSS for my resume instead. Then, I decided to make it with Vue because, 1) I
wanted to use components and 2) because I can! ðŸ¥³


## Usage

If you like the look of my resume, feel free to fork this repository and use
this resume's theme as your own! I would be flatterd if you did. ðŸ˜Š

Everything on it can be tweaked simply by editing
[`resume-data.js`](src/resume-data.js). See the [Data](#data) section for
details.


### Running

This is just a Vue app, so you can install and run it with

```console
$ npm install
$ npm run serve
```

and build it with

```console
$ npm run build
```

The `CoverLetter.vue` view is not available in production &mdash; only when
running locally. See directly [below](#cover-letter).


### Cover Letter

When I write my cover letters, I like for them to have the same header/theme as
my resume. So, I've included a second view in this project which allows me to do
just that. This view is not rendered in production, meaning that even if you
have something written, it won't show up when you deploy it to GitHub pages.

To create a cover letter, simply create a `src/cover-letter.md` file, and start
writing in it. The contents of this file will automatically appear as body-text
in the `/cover-letter` route. **If I were you, I would create this file
regardless of whether you're going to write a cover letter**. Unless you don't
mind Webpack constantly giving you a warning in your `npm run serve` console.


#### Custom Syntax &mdash; Non-indented paragraphs

If you start a paragraph with `//!`, that paragraph will have no text-indent.
This is useful for omitting the indent after a `ul` or `ol`, or, more likely, at
the bottom and top for greetings and signoffs.

```markdown
//! Dear Company President:

I think I'm a great fit for this position. Here's why...

//! &mdash;  <!-- Linebreak with double-spaces enabled -->
Matt
```

Markdown didn't really have anything that would let me do this without
complicating the structure of the DOM or something, so I just ran it through a
simple regular expression.

### Data

#### Body

When making this resume, I always got stuck with my own layout formula. Here's a
quick cheatsheet:

```javascript
export const body = {
  "Blue, underlined (h2)": {
    "Light gray, off to the side (h3)": {
      "Black, within the subsection (h4)": `
        Parsed markdown text. Text is automatically dedented.
      `,
    },
  },
};
```


#### Contact

For the most part, `resume-data.js` is pretty easy to follow. But, the `contact`
object (used for the grid of URLs, phone numbers, and other information at the
top of the page) has some additional possibilies.

For the most basic usage, this is probably all you need:

```javascript
export const contact = {
  service: {
    url: 'https://example.com',
    display: 'Text to display in <a>'
  },
};
```

The `url` field can be omitted if it isn't necessary. This will remove the
hyperlink and just use text.

By default, the following are recognized as services and have the proper
FontAwesome icons set:

| Key in the Object   | FontAwesome Icon          |
| :------------------ | :------------------------ |
| `phone`             | `fa-phone-alt`            |
| `mobile`            | `fa-mobile`               |
| `email`             | `fa-paper-plane`          |
| `github`            | `fa-github`               |
| `twitter`           | `fa-twitter`              |
| `linkedin`          | `fa-linkedin`             |
| `stackoverflow`     | `fa-stack-overflow`       |
| all others          | `fa-external-link-square` |

However, if you don't like these, you can specify `icon` and pass in a valid
FontAwesome icon name (including the `fa-` prefix), and you'll get that icon
instead. By default, `fas` (solid style) will be used. If you'd prefer another
style, like `fal` (light style), you can specify and `iconStyle` in the object.

Finally, if you'd prefer to not have any grid of contact information, you can
simply set `contact` as a whole to `false`.


### FontAwesome

This app uses a single Pro Icon from FontAwesome. If you have FontAwesome Pro,
you have nothing to worry about! Yay! That is, as long as you've previously done
the steps required to use FontAwesome with a package manager:
[FontAwesome Docs][1]

If you don't, here's how to get it working (you're going to have a slightly
different bullet point, `long-arrow-alt-right` instead of `long-arrow-right`):

1.  Uninstall `@fortawesome/font-awesome-pro`, and install
    `@fortawesome/font-awesome-free`:
    ```console
    $ npm uninstall --save @fortawesome/font-awesome-pro
    $ npm install --save @fortawesome/font-awesome-free
    ```
2.  Go to [`main.js`](src/main.js) and change the imports from
    `font-awesome-pro` to `font-awesome-free`:
    ```javascript
    import '@fortawesome/fontawesome-{pro => free}/css/all.min.css';
    import '@fortawesome/fontawesome-{pro => free}/js/all.min.js';
    ```
3.  Head to [`ResumeSubsection.vue`](src/components/ResumeSubsection.vue) and
    get change the `content` and `font-family` declarations at the bottom of the
    file to the following:
    ```css
    * >>> ul ul li::before {
      /* ... */
      font-family: "Font Awesome 5 Free";
      content: "\f30b";
    }
    ```
4.  Done!
